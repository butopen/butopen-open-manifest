# butopen-open-manifesto
Butopen open source projects follows these rules: open source, easy to extend (plugins, addons), on cloud / on premise managed by us / on premise on your own   

## open source
Each project is open source and the development is shared with the community here and on Twitter/Linkedin/ [our blog](https://butopen.com)

## extensibility
We strongly believe that every product user will have specific needs. A product has to have few strong features, and then let specific addons accomodate each specific need. For this reason every butopen project will be designed from the beginning with extensibility in mind.

## community
We will provide docs to easy the process to join our mission and contribute to the projects you're passionate about. Each project README should provide enough information to start. Feel free to reach us using e-mail, twitter, github, linkedin for any question/suggestion.

## business model
We plan to leave the base product open source and free. Every product will be available on cloud (free up to a certain extent to support small teams and single developers), on premise managed by yourself and with a new innovative distribution model: on premise, but managed by us (ex backups, updates, critical patches will all be managed by us).
Since each product is designed with the possibility to be extended, some addons/plugins could be licensed under a payment subscription only (especially for features useful on the enterprise world).
